## Installation

To use the E-Commerce Back-End, you need a code editor like VS Code. Next, you can clone or fork the repo into your editor. Following this, of course run 'npm i' to install necessary dependencies. Next, create a '.env' file in the root folder of the application and enter the necessry lines of code:
'DB_NAME' = 'your_db_name'
'DB_USER' = 'your_mysql_user'
'DB_PASSWORD' = 'your_mysql_password'

Finally, run the necessary commands in the CLI that I show in the video, and presto! You're ready to test the routes, as well as perform CRUD operations (Post, Put, & Delete) in Insomnia!
